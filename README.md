PyGLA, or the Python Group Learning Assessment, is a library package designed to facilitate group-based learning and assess the individual contributions within a group. This approach is based on the findings presented in the paper "The Evolution of a Peer Assessment Method for use in Group-based Teaching of HCI," which provides in-depth information about the concept and its implementation.
